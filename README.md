#  XOR-Encryption
The XOR Encryption Script is a Python utility that performs XOR encryption on the contents of a file using a single character XOR key. XOR encryption is a simple encryption technique that applies an XOR operation between each byte of the data and the ASCII value of the XOR key. This script provides a quick and straightforward way to encrypt the contents of a file and save the encrypted data to another file.

# Prerequisites

    Python 3.x

# Usage

    Clone the repository or download the script.py file to your local machine.

    Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script.py is located.

    Run the script using the following command:
      - python script.py -i <input_file> -o <output_file> -k <xor_key>
      
    Replace <input_file> with the path to the file you want to encrypt, <output_file> with the path where you want to save the encrypted data, and <xor_key> with a single character that will be used as the XOR key.
    
     After running the script, it will display messages indicating the progress and the result of the encryption process.

Note: The XOR key must be a single character. If it is longer than one character, the script will raise an error and exit.

# Example

To encrypt the contents of a file named example.txt using the XOR key 'A' and save the encrypted data to encrypted.txt, run the following command:

    - python script.py -i example.txt -o encrypted.txt -k A
    
# Troubleshooting

    If the script encounters an error during encryption, it will print an error message. Check that the input file exists and is accessible, and ensure that the XOR key is a single character.
